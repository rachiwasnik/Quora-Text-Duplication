# Quora Text Duplication

Objective:
The Quora Text Duplication Project aims to develop a model that accurately identifies duplicate questions within the Quora platform. This involves preprocessing the textual data to remove noise and irrelevant information, followed by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification. The primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between duplicate and non-duplicate question pairs.

Process:
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing pairs of questions from Quora, labeled as duplicate or non-duplicate.

Data Preprocessing:
Removing Punctuation: Strip the text of punctuation marks to ensure consistency in processing.
Removing Unique Characters: Eliminate unique characters that might introduce noise to the model.
Removing Whitespace: Trim excessive whitespace to standardize text formatting.
Removing Numbers: Exclude numerical values as they are often irrelevant to question similarity.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual tokens for further analysis.
Text Normalization: Convert text to lowercase to ensure uniformity in the dataset.

Feature Engineering:
Word Embeddings: Transform the textual data into numerical representations using word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe.
Padding Sequences: Ensure uniform sequence length for input data by padding or truncating text sequences.

Model Building:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Implement a CNN architecture tailored for text classification tasks.
Model Training: Train the CNN model on the preprocessed data to learn the underlying patterns of duplicate and non-duplicate question pairs.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance and generalization.

Evaluation:
Accuracy Metrics: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-Validation: Validate the model's robustness through cross-validation techniques to mitigate overfitting.

Results:
CNN Performance: The CNN model demonstrates promising accuracy in classifying question pairs as duplicate or non-duplicate.
Optimization: Continuous optimization efforts are undertaken to further enhance model accuracy and efficiency.
